## Overview  
This pipeline processes genetic data using various tools and scripts for data preparation, sample filtering, and format conversion. It supports two references:  
- **Reference 38**: PanGenEU 2024  
- **Reference 37**: PanGenEU 2019  

The scripts are organized into key steps, which are explained in detail below.  

## Pipeline Overview

Below is a visual representation of the pipeline from [IDAT to GTC Conversion](#idat-to-gtc-conversion) until [Imputation Data Preparation](#imputation-data-preparation):

## Scripts and Workflow  

### 1. IDAT to GTC Conversion  
These scripts convert raw IDAT data files to GTC files.  
- **`convert_idat_to_gtc.sh`**: Converts IDAT files to GTC files using **Reference 38** (PanGenEU 2024).  
- **`convert_idat_to_gtc19.sh`**: Converts IDAT files to GTC files using **Reference 37** (PanGenEU 2019).  
- **`convert_idat_to_gtc19_skipsamples.sh`**: A modified version of the conversion script that skips specific samples listed in an input file.  

---

### 2. GTC to VCF Conversion  
These scripts convert the GTC files into VCF files.  
- **`convert_gtc_to_vcf.sh`**: Converts GTC files to VCF using **Reference 38** (PanGenEU 2024).  
- **`convert_gtc_to_vcf19.sh`**: Converts GTC files to VCF using **Reference 37** (PanGenEU 2019).  

---

### 3. VCF Merging and Liftover  
#### Merging:  
- **`merge_vcfs.sh`**: Merges and compresses multiple VCF files into a single, combined VCF file.  

#### Liftover (Reference 38 â†’ Reference 37):  
- **`vcf_red.sh`**: Reduces the size of the merged VCF file to make it manageable for liftover.  
- **`vcf_liftover.py`**: Performs the liftover of the VCF file from Reference 38 to Reference 37, ensuring compatibility with downstream processes like the Michigan Imputation Server.  

---

### 4. Sample Comparison and Filtering  
- **`extract_pairs_and_compare.sh`**: Identifies duplicate samples and calculates misalignment, agreement, and disagreement rates. This helps decide which samples to keep or remove for downstream analysis.  

---

### 5. HLA and ABO Analysis  
#### HLA and ABO Extraction:  
- **`splitting_chr_variants_hla_abo.sh`**: Extracts the **HLA region** from Chromosome 6 and the **ABO region** from Chromosome 9. The HLA region is reimputed using the Michigan Imputation Server.  

#### Quality Check and Filtering:  
- **`quality_check_HLA_b4_imp.py`**: Performs a quality check on the extracted HLA region, filtering out variants with an R-squared value below 0.7.  
- **`imputed_hla_filteration.py`**: After HLA imputation, filters out variants with an R-squared value below 0.3.  

#### ABO Inference:  
- **`ABO_predict_final.py`**: Infers blood group types based on the ABO region of the sample.  

---

### 6. VCF Tools and Pre-Imputation Filtering  
- **`vcftools_script.sh`**: Filters VCF files using the following criteria:  
  - Excludes samples and SNPs with high missing rates.  
  - Generates new VCF files with a call rate of at least 80%.  
  - Produces `.bim` and allele frequency files required for imputation.  

---

### 7. Imputation Data Preparation  
Scripts for preparing the filtered VCF files for submission to the Michigan Imputation Server.  
- **`dataprep2024.sh`**: Processes data for **PanGenEU 2024** (Reference 37).  
- **`dataprep2019.sh`**: Processes data for **PanGenEU 2019** (Reference 37).  
These scripts:  
  1. Use the provided Perl script from the server to prepare the data.  
  2. Run the generated script for final processing.  

---

### 8. Post-Imputation Analysis  
#### Principal Component Analysis:  
- **`pc_extraction.sh`**: Extracts dosage data for ethnicity-related SNPs from imputed VCF files.  
- **`psa_cal.R`**: Calculates the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), extracting the first five components and saving them separately.
- **`ibd.sh`**`: Identifies samples with a genetic relatedness coefficient higher than 0.9.  

#### Dataframe Merging:  
- **`abo_txt_prep.py `**: Modification and combination of the ABO blood group datasets.
- **`datatable_merge.R`**: Combines the PCA components and other variables into a single, large dataframe for downstream analysis.

---

### 9. Association and Meta-Analysis  
- **`LR_and_meta_analysis.R`**:  
  This script is used for:  
  1. Association analysis between various genetic and environmental variables.  
  2. Meta-analysis to combine results across different datasets.  
  3. Interaction analysis to identify relationships between variables like blood group, HLA alleles, and phenotype.
